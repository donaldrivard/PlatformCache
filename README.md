# TahoeDreamin17 - Sample Code and Slides
## Making Friends with the Platform Cache (Joint session)
(see http://www.tahoedreamin.com/sessions/joint-session-making-friends-platform-cache/)

This is a very simple implementation of the Platform Cache to show how to use the feature to prepare a matching and to avoid extra queries to the database in actual save / update contexts. Avoiding to do the typical bulkification "query and build a map"-things in the actual context but preparing and caching it is one approach to improve perfomance whenever someone pushes any edit/save/delete button in the user interface.

Slides for my presetation: https://github.com/dstdia/TahoeDreamin17/blob/master/Tahoe%20Dreamin%20Platform%20Cache.pptx
